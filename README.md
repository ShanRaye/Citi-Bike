# Citi-Bike
May 2020 vs. May 2021 Data

Data Sources
Evalauted csv's of May 2020 vs. May 2021 citibike data 

Data Clean Up
Data does not map 1 for 1 between csv's so had to mannually relate
Adjusted data types for latititudes and longitudes
Created calculated fields for distance and duration for 2021 data

Visualizations
Map created with bubbles colored to show average distance traveled per trip by end destination (2021 data)
Compared trip volume from 2020 vs. 2021 (almost doubled YOY)as bar chart leveraging the relationship created
Showed mix of members vs. non members in 2021 data as simple colored table
Showed 2021 popular destinations as a bar chart in descending order

Story
Combines all visuals and then has a dashboard at the end to highlight 2021 data only

Challenges
May 2021 data does not have demographic information
Tableau would time out
File is too large to upload, so cannot follow instructions for submittal (211 MB)
